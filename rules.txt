The game is played between two players (one human, one computer).
Each player has a 10 x 10 board with columns labeled 1 - 10 and rows labeled A - J (see file board.txt).
Players have their own fleets of ships and arrange them on their own boards.
Players take turns firing on their opponent's ships, taking as many shots per turn as the number of their unsunk ships.
Shot locations are called out by referencing board coordinates (e.g., "A3", "B6", etc).
On a board, shots that miss are represented with a / and hits are represented with an X.
Opponents must be alerted when a ship is sunk completely.
Ships are sunk when they've been hit a number of times equal to their size (i.e., the opponent has fired on each board location occupied by the ship).
