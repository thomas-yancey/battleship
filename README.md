This is my attempt at making a battleship game fully in the command line in pure ruby. To run the game clone the repository and run the runner.rb file. Each user can place the range of all of the battleships, the game will throw an error message if the location is not valid or already taken. Users can then guess against their opponents, and when they fully sink a ship will be notified which ship it was that they sank.
